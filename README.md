# AJAX Method Explanation
## Why Fetch API?
- Provides a cleaner syntax compared to older alternatives like `XMLHttpRequest`.
- No need for external libraries such as `axios` for this simple use case.
## But if used:
- XMLHttpRequest: Verbose, callback-based API, not convenient for modern JavaScript.
- *Axios: External library, great features but adds unnecessary dependency for a small project.
